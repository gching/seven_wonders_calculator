# Seven Wonders Calculator

Github repo for a web application that assists in calculating points for players of the board game, 7 Wonders.
Mainly for personal usage, but open to a huger audience if deemed popular.

## Usage

Put your name and the game number from there, input your stats for that game. It will show each player for each game given the game number and rank them according to their points.

## Contribution

As mentioned, this is for personal use. If you want to contribute to this however, just fork and pull! If enough people are interested, we can definitely make this into something official with your help :).
